\section{Logical Operators and Truth Tables}

\subsection*{Sentential Calculus}

In the sentential calculus, there are 16 distinct binary logical operations. The
principle operators we will need are
\begin{itemize}
\item conjunction $\&$,
\item disjunction $\vee$, 
\item implication/conditional $\Rightarrow$, and
\item biconditional $\Leftrightarrow$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent We also have the unary operator negation $\neg$.

The truth tables for these operators are as follows.
\[
  \begin{array}{c|c}
    P & \neg P \\ \hline
    f & t \\
    t & f \\ \hline
  \end{array}
\]

\[
  \begin{array}{cc|cccc}
    P & Q & P \vee Q & P \& Q & P \Rightarrow Q & P \Leftrightarrow Q \\ \hline
    f & f & f & f & t & t \\
    f & t & t & f & t & f \\
    t & f & t & f & f & f \\
    t & t & t & t & t & t \\ \hline
  \end{array}
\]

If we have $P \Leftrightarrow Q$, then we say that $P$ and $Q$ are logically
equivalent. We will need to use logically equivalent forms of formal statements
in this course. Two sentential atoms are equivalent if their truth tables
coincide. Consider the following examples.
\[
  \begin{array}{cc|cc}
    P & Q & \neg(P \vee Q) & \neg P \& \neg Q \\ \hline
    f & f & t & t  \\
    f & t & f & f  \\
    t & f & f & f  \\
    t & t & f & f  \\ \hline
  \end{array}
\]

\noindent This shows that $\neg(P \vee Q)$ and $\neg P \& \neg Q$ are logically
equivalent, that is, $\neg(P \vee Q) \Leftrightarrow (\neg P \& \neg Q)$.

Useful logical equivalencies are the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\neg(P \vee Q) \Leftrightarrow (\neg P \& \neg Q)$,
\item $\neg(P \& Q) \Leftrightarrow \neg P \vee \neg Q$,
\item $(P \Leftrightarrow Q) \Leftrightarrow \Big( (P \Rightarrow Q) \& (Q
  \Rightarrow P) \Big)$,
\item $\neg(P \Rightarrow Q) \Leftrightarrow (P \& \neg Q)$,
\item $(P \Rightarrow Q) \Leftrightarrow (\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P)$,
\item $\Big( (P\&Q)\Rightarrow Q \Big) \Leftrightarrow \Big( P \Rightarrow (R
  \Rightarrow Q) \Big)$,
\item $\Big( P \vee (Q \& R) \Big) \Leftrightarrow \Big( (P \vee Q)\&(P \vee R)
  \Big)$, and
\item $\Big( P\&(Q \vee R) \Big) \Leftrightarrow \Big( (P\&Q)\vee(P\&R) \Big)$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Predicate Calculus}

In the sentential calculus, we are not interested in the form of the particular
sentences $P$, $Q$, $R$, etc. In the predicate calculus, we are. The predicate
calculus uses two quantifiers.
\begin{itemize}
\item For all $\forall$, and
\item there exists $\exists$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent For the predicate calculus, we have some implied domain of definition,
say $D$. For example, $D$ might be a vector space, or all vector spaces, etc. A
property $\PP$ is then a function transformting collections of objects from $D$
to the logical sentences. Given the property $\PP$ and $x \in D$, the statement
$\PP x$ means ``$x$ has the property $P$.'' The sentence $\forall x\;\PP x$
means ``every element $x \in D$ has the property $\PP$.'' This is true precisely
in the case that $\PP x$ is true for every $x \in D$. The sentence $\exists
x\;\PP x$ means ``there is at least one element $x \in D$ that has the property
$\PP$.'' This is true whenever we can find or construct at least one object $x
\in D$ that has the property $\PP$.

The variable $x$ inside $\forall x\;\PP x$ is said to be in the scope of or
bound by the quantifier $\forall$. In the formula $\forall x\;\PP x\&\QQ y$, the
variable $x$ is bound by $\forall$, but the variable $y$ is not bound by any
quantifier. In such a case, the variable $y$ is said to be free. In the
expression $(\forall x\;\PP x)\vee\QQ x$, only the first occurance of $x$ is
bounded; the second occurance is free. Technically, these are different
variables, and a better equivalent way to write it is as $(\forall x\;\PP x)\vee
\QQ y$. Note that a proper logical formula can never have a variable that is
bounded by multiple quantifiers.

We also need to distinguish between free variables and names. A free variable is
allowed to range over all of $D$. A name, however, is a fixed element of $D$.
The previous statement $(\forall x\;\PP x)\vee\QQ y$ has a different meaning if
we take $y$ to a name, i.e., a fixed element of $D$. Similar comments hold when
we replace $\forall$ with $\exists$ in the above discussion.

An expression involving free variables is in general not a proper sentence
unless we assume they are implicitly bound with $\forall$. For example, take $D$
to be $\R$, let $x$ and $y$ be variables, and let $c$ be a name. Consider
\[
  (x=y) \Rightarrow (x+c = y+c).
\]
In this valid expression, $x$ and $y$ are free. By implicitly assuming they are
bound by $\forall$, this is equivalent to
\[
  \forall x\forall y\;\Big( (x=y) \Rightarrow (x+c = y+c) \Big).
\]
We need to be very careful in identifying the free variables, bound variables,
and the names.

In general, one cannot use the truth table method to validate logical
expressions using quantifiers. However, there are some useful equivalencies that
aren't too difficult to intuit. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\neg\forall x\;\PP x \Leftrightarrow \exists x\;\neg\PP x$ (it is not
  true that every element $x \in D$ has $\PP$ is the same as there is at least
  one element $x \in D$ which does not have $\PP$),
\item $\neg\exists x\;\PP x \Leftrightarrow \forall x\;\neg\PP x$ (there does
  not exist an element $x \in D$ with $\PP$ is the same as every element $x \in
  D$ does not have $\PP$),
\item $\forall x\forall y\;\PP xy \Leftrightarrow \forall y\forall x\;\PP xy$
  (note that in general it cannot be assumed that $\PP xy$ and $\PP yx$ are the
  same),
\item $\exists x\exists y\;\PP xy \Leftrightarrow \exists y\exists x\;\PP xy$,
\item $\exists x;\PP xx \Rightarrow \exists x\exists y\;\PP xy$,
\item $\forall x\;\PP x \Rightarrow \exists x\;\PP x$,
\item $\exists x\forall y\;\PP xy \Rightarrow \forall y\exists x\;\PP xy$,
\item $\Big( (\forall x\;\PP x) \& (\forall y\;\QQ y) \Big) \Leftrightarrow
  \forall x\;\PP x \& \QQ x$,
\item $\Big( (\exists x\;\PP x)\vee(\exists y\;\QQ y) \Big) \Leftrightarrow
  \exists x\;\PP x \vee \QQ x$,
\item $(\exists x\;\PP x\&\QQ x) \Rightarrow \Big( (\exists x\;\PP x)\&(\exists
  y\;\QQ y) \Big)$, and
\item $(\forall x\;\PP x \vee \QQ x) \Rightarrow \Big( (\forall x\;\PP
  x)\vee(\forall y\;\QQ y) \Big)$.
\end{itemize}

As a final note, observe that $\forall x\forall y\;\Big( \PP x \Rightarrow (\PP
y \Rightarrow x=y) \Big)$ means if any two elements of the domain $D$ both have
the property $\PP$, then they are equal. This is another way of saying ``there
is a unique element $x \in D$ which has the property $\PP$.'' This is often
simply denoted as $\exists! x\;\PP x$.

\section{Methods of Proof}

We will need to be able to provide deductive proofs of logical sentences of the
form $P \Rightarrow Q$, $P \Leftrightarrow Q$, $\forall x\;\PP x$, and $\exists
x\;\PP x$. 

\subsection*{Proof of Implications $P \Rightarrow Q$}

There are three ways to prove an implication $P \Rightarrow Q$: direct proof,
proof by contradiction, and proof by contraposition. We handle these each in
turn.
\begin{itemize}
\item To prove $P \Rightarrow Q$ directly, means to assume $P$ and use this to
  infer $Q$. This is usually the most natural method of proof.
\item To prove $P \Rightarrow Q$ by contradiction means to assume its negation
  and then derive a contradiction. That is, we assume $\neg(P \Rightarrow Q)$,
  which is equivalent to $P \& \neg Q$, from which we derive a fallacy such as
  $1=0$. From this, our original assumption that $P \Rightarrow Q$ is false is
  incorrect, i.e., $P \Rightarrow Q$ is true.
\item To prove $P \Rightarrow Q$ by contraposition simply means to provide a
  direct proof of $\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Proof of Universal Statements $\forall x\;\PP x$}

To prove the universal statement $\forall x\;\PP x$, we have to show that every
element $x \in D$ has the property $\PP$. To do this, we let $c$ be an arbitrary
name. We then show $\PP c$ is true. Because $c$ was an arbitrary fixed element
of $D$, and because it was shown to have $\PP$, it must be that every element of
$D$ has $\PP$, that is, $\forall x\;\PP x$ is true.

We CANNOT assume anything more than $c$ is an arbitrary fixed element of $D$ in
showing that $c$ has $\PP$. If over the course of showing $\PP c$ we also need
to assume $c$ has the property $\QQ$, then we will NOT have shown $\forall
x\;\PP x$; rather, we will have shown $\forall x\;(\QQ x \Rightarrow \PP x)$.

The method of proof we have described is usually called universal
generalization. It can take special forms such as the various proofs by
induction in the case that $D$ is the natural numbers $\N=\{0,1,2,\dots\}$. We
will cover induction and strong induction in turn. Throughout, remember that we
are assuming $D=\N$.
\begin{itemize}
\item To prove $\forall x\;\PP x$ by induction, we must prove the following
  statements: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Base case: $\PP 0$ (show 0 has $\PP$).
  \item Inductive step: $\forall x\;(\PP x \Rightarrow \PP(x+1))$ (if $x$ has
    $\PP$, then so does $x+1$).
  \end{itemize}
  Having shown these, we can infer $\forall x\;\PP x$.
\item To prove $\forall x\;\PP x$ by strong induction, we must prove the
  following statements: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Base case: $\PP 0$ (show 0 has $\PP$).
  \item Inductive step: $\forall x\forall y\;\Big( y<x \Rightarrow (\PP y
    \Rightarrow \PP x) \Big)$ (if every $y$ smaller than $x$ has $\PP$, then so
    does $x$).
  \end{itemize}
  Having shown these, we can infer $\forall x\;\PP x$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Proof of Existence Statements $\exists x\;\PP x$}

To show $\exists x\;\PP x$, we let $c$ a name, i.e., an element of the domain of
discourse $D$. We then show that $c$ has $\PP$ to infer $\exists x\;\PP x$. If
over the course of showing $\PP c$ we also assume that $c$ has the property
$\QQ$, we will still be able to infer $\exists x\;\PP x$ by the following
string of implications
\[
  (\exists x\;\PP x\&\QQ x) \Rightarrow \Big( (\exists x\;\PP x)\&(\exists
  y\;\QQ y) \Big) \Rightarrow \exists x\;\PP x.
\]

\section{An Example}
 We will work through an example to illustrate some the proof techniques
 outlined above.

\subsection*{Question}

Let $\vec v_1,\,,\vec v_2,\dots,\,\vec v_m \in \R^n$ be such that if $a_1\vec
v_1 + a_2\vec v_2 + \cdots + a_m\vec v_m=0$, for any collection
$a_1,\,a_2,\dots,\,a_m$ of scalars, then $a_1=a_2=\cdots=a_m=0$. Show that every
vector in $\text{span}\{\vec v_1,\,\vec v_2,\dots,\,\vec v_m\}$ has a unique
representation as a linear combination of $\vec v_1,\,,\vec v_2,\dots,\,\vec v_m$.

\subsection*{Logical Form}

The domain of discourse is $\R^n$, the space of column vectors of length $n$
with entries from $\R$. We will also be quantifying over elements from the
subspace $\R$. So, for the sake of clarity we will include whatever domain we
are quantifying over in the quantification statements, that is, we will write
$\forall \vec v_i \in \R^n$ instead of simply $\forall \vec v_i$. We will also
shorten statements like $\forall\vec v_1 \in \R^n\;\forall\vec v_2 \in \R^n
\cdots \forall\vec v_m \in \R^n$ to simply $\forall\vec v_1,\,\vec
v_2,\dots,\,\vec v_m \in \R^n$. Denoting $V=\text{span}\{\vec v_1,\,\vec
v_2,\dots,\,\vec v_m\}$, the logical form of the proposition we want to prove is
then given by
\begin{align*}
  &\Big(
  (\forall a_1,\dots,\,a_m \in \R)\PP(\vec v_1,\dots,\,\vec v_m,\,a_1,\dots,\,a_m)
  \Big) \\
  \Rightarrow&
  \Big(
  (\forall\vec u \in V)(\exists!b_1,\dots,\,b_m \in \R)\QQ(\vec
  u,\,\vec v_1,\dots,\,\vec v_m,\,b_1,\dots,\,b_m)
  \Big)
\end{align*}

\noindent where we taken advantage of free variables to simplify the notation.
We noe the following
\begin{itemize}
\item $\vec v_1,\,\vec v_2,\dots,\,\vec v_m$ are free variables ranging over
  $\R^n$;
\item $\PP(\vec v_1,\dots,\,\vec v_m,\,a_1,\dots,\,a_m)$ means ``if $a_1\vec v_1
  + a_2\vec v_2 + \cdots + a_m\vec v_m =0$, then $a_1=a_2=\cdots=a_m=0$''; and
\item $\QQ(\vec u,\,\vec v_1,\dots,\,\vec v_m,\,b_1,\dots,\,b_m)$ means ``$\vec
  u$ is equal to $b_1\vec v_1 + b_2\vec v_2 + \cdots + b_m\vec v_m$.''
\end{itemize}
