To learn mathematics, you must DO mathematics...

- For a collection of problems with solutions, here is a link to some linear algebra notes by John Erdman.

- For a more technical approach to linear algebra, I recommend the text "Linear Algebra" by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence.
  If you are comfortable with the material and you want more challenging stuff, see the text "Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces" by Halmos.
  You can find pdfs for both of these texts online, or the school library has copies.
